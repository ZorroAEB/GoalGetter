                <ul> <!--List of goal setting tips-->
                    <li>Prioritize-make a list of your goals from most to least important and set your goal accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Set Specific Goals-make goals specific, as in, instead of saying that you will write, say that you will write 50,000 words</li>
                    <li>Set Meausurable Goals-set goals that you can measure like words or hours.</li>
                    <li>Set Relevant Goals-set goals that matter to you, and maybe to the world</li>
                    <li>Set Time Bound Goals-set goals that you have a time limit on, like a New Year's Resolution.</li>
                    <li>Set Achieveable Goals-set goals that will push you, but not push too hard.</li>
                    <li>Set Goals That You Can Control-don't set a goal like: I will change the weather, because you can't control the weather.</li>
                    <li>Manage Your Risks-don't be too risky, as in, don't say that you will climb Mount Everest if you have never climbed a tree.</li>
